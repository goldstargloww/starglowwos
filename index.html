            <p>
                here, we'll be assuming you already have a basic understanding of plurality (in terms of psychology and identity) and what it is. if you don't, i suggest checking out <a href="https://morethanone.info/">morethanone.info</a> as a starting point. if you're interested in knowing more, <a href="https://pluralpedia.org">pluralpedia</a> is a good resource!
            </p>
            <p>
                anyway, hey! we're <b>starglowwOS</b>, sometimes abbreviated as <b>sgOS</b> â€” we use the ðŸŒ  emoji to represent ourselves. sometimes you'll see "ðŸŒ  name", and that's referring to the headmate in our system with that name specifically.
            </p>
            <p>
                a basic list of terms we use and how to refer to us is over at our <a href="https://pronouns.cc/@starglowwOS">prns.cc</a>, but here's a summary that goes into a bit more depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                generally, you don't need to refer to us collectively unless that's specifically your goal â€” <a href="/starglowwos/members/gold">gold</a> is our very frontstuck host, so just use their terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                collectively, we use <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/they/them/their/theirs/themselves,they%2Fthem">they/them</a>, <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/it/it/its/its/itself,it%2Fits">it/its</a>, and <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/.sys/.sys/.sys's/.sys's/.sysself,.sys%2F.sysself">.sys/.sysself</a> pronouns. with they/them and it/its, we usually add an &amp; to the end to signify you're talking about the collective. in terms of second person pronouns, <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/you%26/you%26/your%26/yours%26/yourselves%26,you%26%2Fyours%26">you&amp;/yours&amp;</a> is preferred :&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                we prefer -tive over -ject, so we typically use words like <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Introtive">introtive</a> instead of <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Introject">introject</a>. the distinction between the two is small, but it's one we prefer to make, at least for ourselves. we also use -tive as the umbrella suffix instead of -ject, but we'll definitely refer to others as -jects if they prefer.
            </p>
            <p>
                we use terms like headmates, members, and sysmates to refer to ourselves - please don't use terms like alters, parts, shards, or personalities to refer to us! we're fine with most terms in terms of the collective, though. plural and system are both fine â€” multiple is as well, though we prefer the other two.
            </p>

                        i make things sometimes. feel free to make things inspired by those things :&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        basically, feel free to make any derivative/transformative works based off things i've made. translations, podfics, fanart, even <abbr title="eg. rewrites, redraws">remakes</abbr> if you want, anything like that, go ahead! if applicable, use stuff like <abbr title="archive of our own">ao3</abbr>'s related works feature. otherwise, just link back to the original or otherwise credit me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        feel free to use those things for personal use, too!<br>
                        profile pictures and other profile art is fine. i'm a bit iffy when it comes to using art of myself for those things, though, so at least for now, ask first. fanart though, go on ahead. just, again, link back to the original or otherwise credit me.<br>
                        you do not, however, have permission to use anything i create for or with <abbr title="artificial intelligence">ai</abbr> or for anything commercial.
                    </p>

                        i exist. feel free to make things about me :&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>why is this a sectionï •</i> you may ask. <i>you don't exactly have a following or anything.</i><br>
                        because i feel like it. why not?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i'm aware people on the internet are going to do things regardless of how i feel about it. i'm aware people might make things of me that i'm uncomfortable with. as long as it's not shown to me, i don't care. make it something i'd have to actively look for and you're all good.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        anyway! if you're interested in what i am and am not comfortable with:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i'm not okay with <abbr title="not safe for work">nsfw</abbr> or suggestive stuff being made of me. don't like that.<br>
                        shipping is certainly something. i'm not really sure yet. i'm only for sure comfortable with already established queerplatonic relationships - anything more (ie. romantic, sexual) is a firm no, and anyone else (ie. not my partners) i'm not sure about. if you count platonic shipping, i don't mind, and if you count familial shipping, i don't think i mind.<br>
                        anything else, i'm likely not sure on or just haven't thought about it. in those cases, best bet is to ask, but i won't be upset if you don't.
                    </p>
