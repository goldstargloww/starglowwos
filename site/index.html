      <p>
        here, we'll be assuming you already have a basic understanding of plurality (in terms of psychology and identity) and what it is. if you don't, i suggest checking out <a href="https://morethanone.info/">morethanone.info</a> as a starting point. if you're interested in knowing more, <a href="https://pluralpedia.org">pluralpedia</a> is a good resource!
      </p>
      <p>
        anyway, hey! we're <b>starglowwOS</b>, sometimes abbreviated as <b>sgOS</b> â€” we use the ðŸŒ  emoji to represent ourselves. sometimes you'll see "ðŸŒ  name", and that's referring to the headmate in our system with that name specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
        a basic list of terms we use and how to refer to us is over at our <a href="https://pronouns.cc/@starglowwOS">prns.cc</a>, but here's a summary that goes into a bit more depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        generally, you don't need to refer to us collectively unless that's specifically your goal â€” <a href="/members/gold">gold</a> is our very frontstuck host, so just use their terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        collectively, we use <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/they/them/their/theirs/themselves,they%2Fthem">they/them</a>, <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/it/it/its/its/itself,it%2Fits">it/its</a>, and <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/.sys/.sys/.sys's/.sys's/.sysself,.sys%2F.sysself">.sys/.sysself</a> pronouns. with they/them and it/its, we usually add an &amp; to the end to signify you're talking about the collective. in terms of second person pronouns, <a href="https://pronouns.cc/pronouns/you%26/you%26/your%26/yours%26/yourselves%26,you%26%2Fyours%26">you&amp;/yours&amp;</a> is preferred :&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        we prefer -tive over -ject, so we typically use words like <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Introtive">introtive</a> instead of <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Introject">introject</a>. the distinction between the two is small, but it's one we prefer to make, at least for ourselves. we also use -tive as the umbrella suffix instead of -ject, but we'll definitely refer to others as -jects if they prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
        we use terms like headmates, members, and sysmates to refer to ourselves - please don't use terms like alters, parts, shards, or personalities to refer to us! we're fine with most terms in terms of the collective, though. plural and system are both fine â€” multiple is as well, though we prefer the other two.
